# CP/M-86 Miscellaneous Ports

## Synopsis

A collection of c tools ported to CP/M-86

## Build Environment

- Makefile for DOS Aztec C cross compilers targetting CP/M-86.  (May require adaptation. emu2 is used to run dos compiler on unix/mac)
- aztec c compiler version 3.4
```
- The Super Cool emu2 DOS emulator to run the DR tools on macOS and Linux (https://github.com/dmsc/emu2). This is an incredible way to bring dos command line development tools to a modern and up to date shell/make/whatever based dev environment. Another stunning emulator. Emu2 and PCE are an incredible pair.

For a rudimentary, cross development environment, look at (https://github.com/tsupplis/cpm86-crossdev).

Some submit/batch scripts are provided for dos (aztec 3.4) and cp/m-86 (aztec 3.2) are also available.

## Test Environment

- The Excellent PCE emulator (http://www.hampa.ch/pce/pce-ibmpc.html)
- mtools 4 and cpmtools 2.20
